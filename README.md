# UCSD PSYC201A Reproduction Project: Kim & Kim (2022 *PNAS*)

written by **Jinwoo Lee** ([jil527@ucsd.edu](jil527@ucsd.edu))

This repository serves as a workspace for the Reproducibility Project in UCSD PSYC201A. The goal of this project is to reproduce the statistics of the following key result reported in **Kim & Kim (2022, *PNAS*)**:

> Mantel tests revealed that the (young adults’) left amygdala–ventral PFC tract-morphology dissimilarity matrix was significantly correlated with the trait-anxiety dissimilarity matrix (P = 0.036).

## Code Availability
All dependencies required to run the code are stored in a **Pixi-based** virtual environment named ‘kim2024’ (note: “2024” is a typo of “2022” in the original naming). To set up and use the environment, please follow the steps below:     

1. Clone the GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/psyc-201/kim2022.git`.    
2. Activate the Pixi-based virtual environment in your local machine: `pixi shell`.    
3. When using Jupyter, select the kernel named “**Python (kim2024)**”.       

## Data Availability    
This project assumes the presence of preprocessed datasets directly shared by the original authors for reproduction purposes. To request access to the data, please contact Dr. Justin Minue Kim ([minuekim@skku.edu](minuekim@skku.edu)), the corresponding author of Kim & Kim (2022 *PNAS*). Once you receive the data, place it in a folder named `data-from-authors` located in the top-level directory of this project.
