    "### Step 1. Loading the Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of DIM Package\n",
    "In addition to basic packages such as pandas, I will import my DIM package. `Level1` class is specifically designed for performing conventional inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA; e.g., Anna Karenina Modeling).    \n",
    "\n",
    "When running a traditional IS-RSA with a `Level1` model, the following parameters should be defined first:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **model**: Choose one of the two theoretically defined IS-RSA models; ['AnnaK' or 'NearestN']  \n",
    "  - `AnnaK`: assuming that participants with higher trait anxiety scores will show (dis)similar brain morphology.\n",
    "  - `NearestN`: assuming that participants with (dis)similar triat anxiety scores will show (dis)similar brain morphology.      \n",
    "  *Example:* Kim & Kim (2022) tested the model using Anna Karenina → `AnnaK`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **distance**: Define which metric to calculate the relationship between participants in the test domain (in our case, trait anxiety). Available metrics depend on the model.  \n",
    "  - if `model == 'AnnaK'`: ['Mean' or 'Min']  \n",
    "  - if `model == 'NearestN'`: ['Euclidean' or 'Cosine']       \n",
    "  *Example:* Kim & Kim (2022) used the mean metric with the AnnaK model → `Mean`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **weighting**: When there are two or more input variables in the test domain, choose how to weight each variable when calculating participant relationships; ['None' or 'Learn']  \n",
    "  - `None`: weighting all X features equally\n",
    "  - `Learn`: optimizing the weight of each X feature to maximize the correlation between the test and target domains    \n",
    "  *Example:* Kim & Kim (2022) used only one variable (STAI total score), so no weighting was applied → `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dependency**: Choose the metric to calculate the correlation between domains; ['Pearson' or 'Spearman']  \n",
    "  - `Pearson`: Pearson’s r  \n",
    "  - `Spearman`: Spearman’s rho       \n",
    "  *Example:* Kim & Kim (2022) calculated the correlation between STAI and brain distance matrices using Spearman’s rho → `Spearman`\n",
    "\n",
    "The defined Level1 model gets **(n_subjects * n_features)** shaped test domain dataframe and **(n_subjects * n_subjects)** shaped distance matrix of the target domain. In my case, I will input (119, 1) shaped STAI total score vector and (119, 119) shaped brain morphology distance matrix. After that, `DIM`'s Level1 model will compute the distance matrix of STAI scores based on the specified IS-RSA model and paramters, and then calculate the correlation between the two distance matrices.\n",

The authors’ R-based `vegan::mantel` function uses one-sided testing (`greater`) for P-value calculation (see [here](https://vegandevs.github.io/vegan/reference/mantel.html)). Accordingly, we also use one-sided testing rather than a two-sided test.  \n",

Although there is a slight difference of approximately 0.001 in the *P*-value, this can be attributed to the inherent randomness of the permutation test. Even though the same seed (‘42’) was used, the internal random number generation algorithms of R and Python differ. Therefore, in our Preregistration Report, we pre-defined reproduction success/failure based on two criteria:  \n",

    "1. Whether the estimated ρ is identical to the third decimal place.       \n",
